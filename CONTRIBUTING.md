# Contributing to OpenChamber

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openchamber/openchamber.git
cd openchamber
bun install
```

## Dev Scripts

Run commands from the project root unless a section says otherwise.

### Web

| Script | Description | Ports |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| `bun run dev` | Default web HMR dev flow. | auto-selected dev ports |
| `bun run dev:web:full` | Build watcher + Express server. No HMR — manual refresh after changes. | `3001` (server + static) |
| `bun run dev:web:hmr` | Vite dev server + Express API. **Open the Vite URL for HMR**, not the backend. | `5180` (Vite HMR), `3902` (API) |
| `bun run start:web` | Start the packaged web server. | `3000` by default |

Both are configurable via env vars: `OPENCHAMBER_PORT`, `OPENCHAMBER_HMR_UI_PORT`, `OPENCHAMBER_HMR_API_PORT`.

### Desktop (Electron)

```bash
bun run electron:dev          # HMR web UI + Electron shell
bun run electron:dev:bundled  # Electron shell using built web assets
bun run electron:build        # Package desktop app for the current platform
```

Desktop supports macOS, Windows, and Linux. The build output is written to `packages/electron/dist`.

macOS builds create `dmg` and `zip` files. You need Xcode/build tools for notarized packaging and icon asset work.

Windows builds create an NSIS installer. If signing env vars are not set, the build script makes an unsigned installer.

Linux builds produce an AppImage for the native x64 or arm64 host.

For desktop-specific details, see [`packages/electron/README.md`](./packages/electron/README.md).

### VS Code Extension

```bash
bun run vscode:dev      # Watch mode + Extension Development Host
bun run vscode:build    # Build extension + webview
bun run vscode:package  # Create a local .vsix package
```

`bun run vscode:dev` opens an Extension Development Host automatically. You can override the editor or workspace with `OPENCHAMBER_VSCODE_BIN` and `OPENCHAMBER_VSCODE_DEV_WORKSPACE`.

Example: `OPENCHAMBER_VSCODE_BIN=cursor bun run vscode:dev`.

### Shared UI (`packages/ui`)

No standalone app server. This is a source-level library used by Web, Desktop, and VS Code.

Useful package commands:

```bash
bun run build:ui
bun run type-check:ui
bun run lint:ui
```

## Build And Package Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `bun run build` | Build all workspaces |
| `bun run build:web` | Build only `packages/web` |
| `bun run build:ui` | Build only `packages/ui` |
| `bun run build:electron` | Run Electron package build script without full packaging |
| `bun run electron:build` | Build packaged desktop app for the current OS |
| `bun run vscode:build` | Build the VS Code extension |
| `bun run vscode:package` | Package the VS Code extension as `.vsix` |
| `bun run pack:web` | Create a package archive for `@openchamber/web` |

## Platform Build Notes

You usually build desktop installers on the target platform.

macOS:

```bash
bun run electron:build
bun run release:test:intel
bun run release:test:arm
```

Windows:

```bash
bun run electron:build
```

Linux x64 and arm64 AppImages are packaged natively on the matching host architecture. Use Bun for dependency installation and packaging orchestration:

```bash
OPENCHAMBER_TARGET_ARCH=x64 bun run electron:build
# On an arm64 host:
OPENCHAMBER_TARGET_ARCH=arm64 bun run electron:build

bun run --cwd packages/electron verify:linux-appimage
```

The final AppImage verifier checks desktop identity and the architecture of Electron, the bundled OpenCode CLI, and packaged native modules.

## Before Submitting

```bash
bun run type-check   # Must pass
bun run lint         # Must pass
bun run build        # Must succeed
```

For docs-only changes, validation may be enough:

```bash
bun run docs:validate
```

## Code Style

- Functional React components only
- TypeScript strict mode — no `any` without justification
- Use existing theme colors/typography from `packages/ui/src/lib/theme/` — don't add new ones
- Components must support light and dark themes
- Prefer early returns and `if/else`/`switch` over nested ternaries
- Tailwind v4 for styling; typography via `packages/ui/src/lib/typography.ts`

## Pull Requests

1. Fork and create a branch
2. Make changes
3. Run the validation commands above
4. Submit PR with clear description of what and why

## Not a developer?

You can still help:

- Report bugs or UX issues — even "this felt confusing" is valuable feedback
- Test on different devices, browsers, or OS versions
- Suggest features or improvements via issues
- Help others in Discord
