# Git Module Documentation

## Purpose
This module provides Git repository operations for the web server runtime, including repository management, branch/worktree operations, status/diff queries, commit handling, and merge/rebase workflows.

## Entrypoints and structure
- `packages/web/server/lib/git/`: Git module directory containing all Git-related functionality.
  - `index.js`: Public API entry point imported by `packages/web/server/index.js`.
  - `routes.js`: Express route registration for `/api/git/*` endpoints.
  - `service.js`: Core Git operations (repository, branch, worktree, commit, merge/rebase, status/diff, log).
  - `credentials.js`: Git credentials management.
  - `identity-storage.js`: Git identity (user.name, user.email) storage.

## Public API

The following functions are exported and used by the web server:

### Repository Operations
- `isGitRepository(directory)`: Check if a directory is a Git repository.
- `getGlobalIdentity()`: Get global Git user.name, user.email, and core.sshCommand.
- `getCurrentIdentity(directory)`: Get local Git identity (fallback to global if not set locally).
- `hasLocalIdentity(directory)`: Check if local Git identity is configured.
- `setLocalIdentity(directory, profile)`: Set local Git identity (userName, userEmail, authType, sshKey/host).
- `getRemoteUrl(directory, remoteName)`: Get URL for a specific remote.

### Status and Diff Operations
- `getStatus(directory)`: Get comprehensive Git status including current branch, tracking, ahead/behind, file changes, diff stats, merge/rebase state.
- `getDiff(directory, { path, staged, contextLines })`: Get diff output for files or entire working tree.
- `getRangeDiff(directory, { base, head, path, contextLines })`: Get diff between two refs.
- `getRangeFiles(directory, { base, head })`: Get list of changed files between two refs.
- `getFileDiff(directory, { path, staged })`: Get original and modified file contents for a single file (handles images as data URLs).
- `collectDiffs(directory, files)`: Collect diff output for multiple files.
- `revertFile(directory, filePath, options)`: Revert a file. Default scope `all` discards staged and working-tree changes; scope `working` discards only unstaged/working-tree changes.
- `stageFile(directory, filePath)`: Add one file path to the index.
- `unstageFile(directory, filePath)`: Remove one file path from the index while preserving working-tree content.
- `applyHunk(directory, filePath, options)`: Apply a single-hunk patch via `git apply`. `options.action` is `stage` (`git apply --cached`), `unstage` (`git apply --cached --reverse`), or `discard` (`git apply --reverse` in the working tree). The patch is written to a temp file; a `--check` runs first so a stale hunk fails with a clear "refresh and try again" error instead of a partial mutation. The patch target path must match the requested file.

### Branch Operations
- `getBranches(directory)`: Get list of local and remote branches (filtered to active remote branches).
- `createBranch(directory, branchName, options)`: Create and checkout a new branch.
- `checkoutBranch(directory, branchName)`: Checkout an existing branch.
- `deleteBranch(directory, branch, options)`: Delete a branch (supports force flag).
- `renameBranch(directory, oldName, newName)`: Rename a branch and preserve upstream tracking.
- `getRemotes(directory)`: Get list of configured remotes.

### Worktree Operations
- `getWorktrees(directory)`: List all git worktrees for a repository.
- `validateWorktreeCreate(directory, input)`: Validate worktree creation parameters (mode, branchName, startRef, upstream config).
- `createWorktree(directory, input)`: Create a new worktree (supports 'new' and 'existing' modes, upstream setup).
- `removeWorktree(directory, input)`: Remove a worktree (optionally delete local branch).
- `isLinkedWorktree(directory)`: Check if directory is a linked worktree (not primary).

### Commit and Remote Operations
- `commit(directory, message, options)`: Create a commit from the current index. `options.stageFiles` may be provided with `options.files` by older callers to stage only selected unstaged rows before committing, but the shared Git panel now stages/unstages explicitly before commit.
- `pull(directory, options)`: Pull changes from remote.
- `push(directory, options)`: Push changes to remote (auto-sets upstream if needed).
- `fetch(directory, options)`: Fetch changes from remote.
- `removeRemote(directory, options)`: Remove a configured remote (except `origin`).
- `deleteRemoteBranch(directory, options)`: Delete a remote branch.

### Log Operations
- `getLog(directory, options)`: Get commit history with stats (supports maxCount, from, to, file filters).
- `getCommitFiles(directory, commitHash)`: Get file changes for a specific commit.
- `getCommitFileDiff(directory, hash, filePath, isBinary)`: Get before/after content for a specific file in a commit. Returns `{ original, modified, isBinary }`. Runs `git show <hash>^:<path>` and `git show <hash>:<path>` in parallel; returns empty strings on failure (added/deleted/root-commit edge cases).

### Merge and Rebase Operations
- `rebase(directory, options)`: Start a rebase onto a target branch.
- `abortRebase(directory)`: Abort an in-progress rebase.
- `continueRebase(directory)`: Continue a rebase after conflict resolution.
- `merge(directory, options)`: Merge a branch into current branch.
- `abortMerge(directory)`: Abort an in-progress merge.
- `continueMerge(directory)`: Continue a merge after conflict resolution.
- `getConflictDetails(directory)`: Get detailed conflict information including operation type, unmerged files, and diff.

### Stash Operations
- `listStashes(directory)`: List stash entries with ref, message, relative time, and hash.
- `countStashFiles(directory, refs)`: Batch-count changed files for stash refs with bounded concurrency.
- `stashPush(directory, options)`: Stash changes, always including untracked files, with optional message.
- `stashApply(directory, options)`: Apply a stash by ref without removing it.
- `stashPop(directory, options)`: Apply a stash by ref and drop it only after a successful apply.
- `stashDrop(directory, options)`: Drop a stash by ref.

## Internal Helpers

The following functions are internal helpers used by exported functions:
- `buildSshCommand(sshKeyPath)`: Build SSH command string for git config.
- `buildGitEnv()`: Build Git environment with SSH_AUTH_SOCK resolution.
- `createGit(directory)`: Create simple-git instance with environment.
- `normalizeDirectoryPath(value)`: Normalize directory paths (supports ~ expansion).
- `cleanBranchName(branch)`: Remove refs/heads/ or refs/ prefixes.
- `parseWorktreePorcelain(raw)`: Parse `git worktree list --porcelain` output.
- `resolveWorktreeProjectContext(directory)`: Resolve project context (projectID, primaryWorktree, worktreeRoot).
- `resolveCandidateDirectory(...)`: Generate unique worktree directory candidates.
- `resolveBranchForExistingMode(...)`: Resolve branch for existing-mode worktree creation.
- `applyUpstreamConfiguration(...)`: Set upstream tracking for new branches.
- And various other internal helpers for Git command execution and parsing.

## Response Contracts

### Status Response
- `current`: Current branch name.
- `tracking`: Upstream branch (e.g., 'origin/main').
- `ahead`: Number of commits ahead of upstream.
- `behind`: Number of commits behind upstream.
- `upstreamComparison`: Optional comparison against `upstream/<current-branch>`, with `{ remote, branch, ahead, behind }`.
- `files`: Array of file objects with `path`, `index`, `working_dir` status codes.
- `isClean`: Boolean indicating if working tree is clean.
- `diffStats`: Object mapping file paths to `{ insertions, deletions }`.
- `mergeInProgress`: Object with `{ head, message }` if merge in progress.
- `rebaseInProgress`: Object with `{ headName, onto }` if rebase in progress.

### Staged and unstaged change handling
- `status.files` exposes both `index` and `working_dir` codes. Shared UI uses these as separate scopes: staged rows are derived from non-empty `index` statuses, while unstaged rows are derived from `working_dir` statuses and untracked files.
- A file with both staged and unstaged changes can appear in both UI sections. Staged rows request diffs with `staged: true`; unstaged rows request normal working-tree diffs.
- The shared Git panel exposes explicit staging actions. Unstaged rows use `stageFile`, staged rows use `unstageFile`, and commits operate on the current staged index.
- `stageFiles` remains supported for callers that need to stage a selected unstaged subset as part of commit. In that mode the server temporarily unstages unrelated index entries, stages `stageFiles`, commits from the index, then restores temporarily unstaged entries.
### Worktree Create/Remove Response
- `head`: HEAD commit SHA.
- `name`: Worktree name.
- `branch`: Local branch name.
- `path`: Absolute path to worktree directory.
- `directoryCreated`: Present when create returned after the target directory exists while background Git/bootstrap work continues.
- `bootstrapStatus`: Background setup state. The legacy `status` remains `pending`, `ready`, or `failed`, while `phase` reports `directory-created`, `git-ready`, or `setup-ready`. Fast create starts at `pending`/`directory-created`; population and upstream Git completion advances to `pending`/`git-ready` before setup/start scripts; completed setup is `ready`/`setup-ready`. A missing in-memory state falls back to `ready`/`setup-ready`; clients continue to accept legacy status responses that omit `phase`.
- Fast-create background failures remove OpenCode sandbox metadata for directories that never became Git worktrees, and remove the pre-created directory only if it is still empty. User-created files are never recursively deleted by this cleanup.
- Worktree removal waits for any active create/bootstrap task for that directory before deleting it, preventing a background Git or setup task from restoring removed state or racing filesystem cleanup.
- Worktree bootstrap retries transient `index.lock` conflicts. If the lock remains byte-for-byte and metadata-identical across the retry window, it is treated as stale, removed, and population continues automatically; changing locks are left untouched and reported as failures.

### Log Response
- `all`: Array of commit objects with hash, date, message, author info, stats.
- `latest`: Latest commit object or null.
- `total`: Total number of commits.

## Notes for Contributors

### Adding a New Git Operation
1. Add the function to `packages/web/server/lib/git/service.js`.
2. Export the function if it's part of the public API.
3. Use `createGit(directory)` to get a simple-git instance with the correct environment.
4. Use `runGitCommand(cwd, args)` for direct git command execution with better error handling.
5. Use `runGitCommandOrThrow(cwd, args, fallbackMessage)` for commands that must succeed.
6. Return consistent error messages; use `parseGitErrorText(error)` to extract meaningful git errors.
7. Update this file with the new function in the appropriate API section.

### SSH Key Handling
- SSH keys are escaped and validated via `escapeSshKeyPath` to prevent command injection.
- On Windows, paths are converted to MSYS format (`C:/path` → `/c/path`).
- SSH_AUTH_SOCK is automatically resolved via `resolveSshAuthSock` (checks GPG agent, gpgconf).

### Worktree Naming
- Worktree names are slugified via `slugWorktreeName`.
- Random names use adjectives/nouns from `OPENCODE_ADJECTIVES` and `OPENCODE_NOUNS` lists.
- Branches created for new worktrees use `openchamber/<worktree-name>` pattern.

### Cross-Platform Considerations
- Use `normalizeDirectoryPath` for all directory inputs to handle `~` and path separators.
- Use `canonicalPath` for path comparisons to handle case-insensitive filesystems (Windows).
- Windows Git commands use MSYS/MinGW paths; avoid direct Windows paths in git commands.

### Error Handling
- All exported functions should throw errors with descriptive messages.
- Use `console.error` for logging Git operation failures.
- Return structured objects for operations that need partial success reporting (e.g., merge/rebase conflicts).

### Testing
- Run `bun run type-check`, `bun run lint`, and `bun run build` before finalizing changes.
- Consider edge cases: non-Git directories, missing remotes, conflict states, concurrent worktree operations.
