# Session Sidebar Documentation

## Refactor result

- `SessionSidebar.tsx` now acts mainly as orchestration; core logic moved to focused hooks/components.
- Sidebar is now a single multi-project tree: `recent` top section, then projects, then worktrees/archived groups, then sessions.
- `NavRail` is no longer part of sidebar/navigation flow.
- Project headers now own root sessions directly; there is no separate rendered `project root` subgroup.
- Active/hover row styling is text-first; selected sessions use primary text instead of background fills.
- Archived groups are collapsed by default and support bulk deletion at group/folder level.
- Session rows support compact inline dates in minimal mode and simplified metadata in default mode.
- Root session menus can quickly create a worktree from the session directory's current branch and move the full session subtree there while idle.
- Directory loading is demand-driven: the sidebar publishes one complete priority plan for all known project/worktree directories, while the sync layer owns bounded execution.
- New extractions in latest pass reduced local effect/callback bulk further:
  - project session list builders
  - authoritative deletion cleanup
  - sticky project header observer

## VS Code grouping

- VS Code uses the **same grouped project tree** as web/desktop (project headers + folders + pinned-first ordering), not a separate flat list. Each open VS Code workspace folder is a project header.
- VS Code groups strictly **by open workspace**: `useSessionGrouping` funnels every non-archived session into the project's root group and emits **no per-worktree subgroups** (worktrees aren't registered in VS Code). `getSessionsForProject` buckets sessions to a workspace by exact directory match, so only sessions whose directory is an open workspace folder appear.
- VS Code passes `hideDirectoryControls` (clean workspace headers, no worktree/close chrome) and no longer passes `showOnlyMainWorkspace`/`sharedSessionsOnly`. Folders and pinning therefore work natively, scoped to the workspace root.

## File summaries

### Components

- `SidebarHeader.tsx`: Top header UI for add-project, session search, and display mode.
- `SidebarActivitySections.tsx`: Global top section renderer; currently used for the `recent` section only.
- `SidebarFooter.tsx`: Static footer with icon-only settings, shortcuts, and about actions.
- `SidebarProjectsList.tsx`: Main scrollable tree renderer for projects, root sessions, worktrees/groups, and empty/search states.
- `SessionGroupSection.tsx`: Renders a single worktree/archived group, collapse/expand, folder subtree, group-level controls, and explicit loading/error/retry state for empty groups.
- `SessionNodeItem.tsx`: Renders one session row/tree node with inline metadata, menu actions, minimal/default variants, and nested children. Rows do not initiate directory bootstrap on mount.
- `ConfirmDialogs.tsx`: Shared confirm dialog wrappers for session delete and folder delete flows.
- `sortableItems.tsx`: DnD sortable wrappers for project and group ordering plus project-row action affordances.
- `sessionFolderDnd.tsx`: Folder/session DnD scope and wrappers for dropping/moving sessions into folders.
- `sessionOwnership.ts`: Resolves session directories once into shared project/worktree ownership and folder-scope indexes.

### Hooks

- `hooks/useSessionActions.ts`: Centralizes session row actions (select/open, rename, share/unshare, archive/delete, confirmations).
- `hooks/useSessionSearchEffects.ts`: Handles search open/close UX and input focus behavior.
- `hooks/useSessionPrefetch.ts`: Publishes directory-aware nearby/active session prefetch demand to the shared message loader. Recent may prefetch across projects without substituting the current directory.
- `hooks/useSessionGrouping.ts`: Builds grouped session structures and search text/filter helpers.
- `hooks/useSessionSidebarSections.ts`: Composes final per-project sections and group search metadata for rendering.
- `hooks/useProjectSessionSelection.ts`: Resolves active/current project-session selection logic and session-directory context.
- `hooks/useGroupOrdering.ts`: Applies persisted/custom group order with stable fallback ordering; archived groups are reorderable.
- `hooks/useArchivedAutoFolders.ts`: Maintains archived auto-folder structure and assignment behavior.
- `hooks/useSidebarPersistence.ts`: Persists sidebar UI state (expanded/collapsed/pinned/group order/active session) to storage + desktop settings.
- `hooks/useProjectRepoStatus.ts`: Tracks per-project git-repo state and root branch metadata.
- `hooks/useProjectSessionLists.ts`: Reads live and archived project buckets from the shared ownership index.
- `hooks/useAuthoritativeSessionCleanup.ts`: Establishes the first complete active+archived list as a non-destructive baseline, then cleans persisted state only for sessions omitted by a later authoritative snapshot.
- `hooks/useStickyProjectHeaders.ts`: Tracks which project headers are sticky/stuck via `IntersectionObserver`.

### Types and utilities

- `types.ts`: Shared sidebar types (`SessionNode`, `SessionGroup`, summary/search metadata).
- `activitySections.ts`: Persisted top-section storage/helpers for the current `recent` session list.
- `sessionBootstrapDemands.ts`: Builds the deduplicated directory demand plan. Selected directories rank above active projects, expanded groups, visible collapsed groups, and background/collapsed projects.
- `utils.tsx`: Shared sidebar utilities (path normalization, sorting, dedupe, archived scope keys, project relation checks, text highlight, labels, compact/default date formatting).

## Loading rules

- Always publish every known project root and worktree directory. Collapse/visibility changes priority only; they do not opt a directory out of authoritative refresh.
- Current directory and selected-session directory are `selected` demand and therefore run first.
- Expanded projects/worktrees outrank merely visible and background groups.
- The sync scheduler deduplicates, promotes, retries, and limits work. Sidebar components must not reproduce that lifecycle with mount effects.
- Hide speculative work when the sidebar/chat surface is hidden: message prefetch, Git/PR enrichment and subscriptions, search listeners, sticky-header observation, and archived-folder derivation stop. The session row tree unmounts so row-owned status, permission, unseen, and viewport subscriptions do no background work. The outer sidebar remains mounted, preserving UI state and authoritative directory refresh for an immediate reopen; deferred derived work reruns from current state when visibility returns.
- The sidebar does not subscribe its whole tree to the cross-directory live-session aggregate. Global create/structural/lifecycle snapshots drive rendered session metadata; the cached sync index only fills sessions not yet present globally and provides refresh fallback data. Row activity continues to come from the session-keyed live status index.
- Session selection does not invalidate the sidebar orchestration component. Each mounted row selects only whether its own session ID is active, while parent expansion, project selection memory, and neighbor prefetch run in small effect-only subscribers.
- Parent expansion is exclusively manual. Selecting or navigating to a subsession never expands its parent automatically. Project/worktree and `recent` trees use independent persisted context keys and receive separate stable projections, so expansion changes in one context neither invalidate nor change the other. The persisted storage key remains `v3`; older state mixed contexts and is not migrated into this contract.
- Folder membership may contain both a parent session and its descendants. Rendering treats only the highest assigned ancestors as folder roots because their normal session trees already include assigned descendants; persisted membership remains unchanged for cleanup and move semantics.
- Sidebar selection holds the clicked row's viewport position across navigation-driven sidebar updates. Wheel or touch input cancels the hold immediately, so programmatic compensation never fights intentional scrolling.
- Global session subscriptions are structural: create/delete, title, share, archive, directory, parent, and slug changes invalidate the tree. Recency-only `time.updated` changes are read from the authoritative snapshot on the next sidebar render rather than triggering a full tree rebuild themselves.
- Structural updates rebuild grouped nodes only for projects whose local sessions, worktrees, repository state, or branch changed; unchanged project sections preserve references so memoized group/session descendants skip the update wave.
- Empty successful lists, unresolved loads, and failed loads are separate UI states. Failed groups expose Retry and retain prior data.
- Pins and folder assignments are not pruned from the first startup snapshot or from optimistic mutations. Confirmed local deletion and routed external deletion clean immediately; a later authoritative omission after an established baseline covers missed external delete events.
